W5_project_tips:

We should try to achieve a greatest accuracy number testing at least twice. 
- change the sample data (if it's imbalanced) [bank ex and iris ex]
- clean more the data
- data wrangling

Kind of error
- Reducible error - add some variables / generalisations into our model to iterate towards better accuracy
e.g: titanic: assume "women's first", split by children/women, split by class, no of siblings/spouses,parents/children...
-Irreducible error - survival based on chance 

Consider if the model is overfit (notebook graph).

CLASS IMBALANCE: it is a huge different amount of samples of class (if we choose the 2nd project we should check this)
- downsampling (use less samples from the majority class. This would limit the level of effectiveness. ) = underfitting
- uspampling (repeating samples from the minority class. It doesn't add new information) = overfitting
