w4d4_FEATURE METHODS 

_FEATURE SELECTION: simiplicity is good 
_FEATURE SCALING, bring features to the same range so that they have the same weight in the algorithm
_FEATURE ENGINEERING / EXTRACTION: create new features, typically out of current ones

LOW VARIANCE: when all obs have the same value for a feature, the feature is no adding much. Remove it!

COLLINEARITY: if two features have a perfect correlation (r=1), they are just the same feature!
