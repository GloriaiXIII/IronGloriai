--> Logistic model for binary regression

Some assumptions:
- Does not requere a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables 
- Multicollinerarity not relevant
- Dependant variablee must be categorical and can only have two possible values (yes/no, 1/0, t/f)
- Larger dataset, at least 10 cases for each possible target value
